# `genui_client` Package Implementation

## Purpose

The `genui_client` package is a Flutter package that enables the creation of applications with dynamically generated user interfaces. It is responsible for defining the set of available UI components (the "catalog"), communicating with a `genui_server` backend, and rendering the UI definitions received from it.

## Architecture

The package provides the necessary components to manage the client-side of a GenUI application. The primary entry point for applications is the `UiAgent` facade.

        A[App Logic] -- "Uses" --> B(UiAgent);
    end

    subgraph "genui_client Package"
        B -- "Orchestrates" --> C(GenUIClient);
        B -- "and" --> D(GenUiManager);
        C -- "HTTP Communication" --> E((genui_server));
        D -- "Manages State for" --> F(GenUiSurface);
        F -- "Builds Widgets using" --> G(Catalog);
    end
```

### Core Components

1.  **`Catalog`**: A collection of `CatalogItem`s. This is the cornerstone of the client's capabilities, defining every widget that the application knows how to render. The `Catalog` can be serialized to a JSON schema to be sent to the server.

2.  **`GenUIClient`**: This class handles all network communication with the `genui_server`.

    -   It manages the `sessionId` for the conversation.
    -   **`startSession(Catalog catalog)`**: Performs the initial handshake.
    -   **`generateUI(String sessionId, List<ChatMessage> conversation)`**: Returns a `Stream<ChatMessage>` from the server. The client listens to this stream to receive real-time UI updates and final text messages.

3.  **`GenUiManager`**: The client-side state manager for all dynamic UI surfaces. It implements the `SurfaceBuilder` interface and holds the `WidgetValueStore` to maintain the state of individual widgets (e.g., text field input).

4.  **`UiAgent`**: A high-level facade and the primary entry point for the package. It simplifies the interaction with the various components by orchestrating the `GenUiManager` and `GenUIClient`. It also manages the conversation history.

5.  **`UiEventManager`**: A class that manages UI events, coalescing UI state changes and sending them to the AI client when an action is triggered.

6.  **`GenUiSurface`**: A Flutter widget that listens to the `GenUiManager` (via the `SurfaceBuilder` interface) and recursively builds the Flutter widget tree from the UI definitions.

### UI Widgets

The package also provides high-level widgets to quickly build chat-based UIs.

1.  **`GenUiChat`**: A complete chat widget that integrates with a `UiAgent` to provide a user interface for sending messages and displaying conversation history, including rendered UI surfaces from the AI.

2.  **`ConversationWidget`**: A widget that displays the conversation history from a `UiAgent`, but without the input box, giving more control over the UI.

3.  **`ChatBox`**: A widget that provides a text input field for a chat interface.

## Data Flow

The client drives the conversation and reacts to a stream of UI updates from the server, orchestrated by the `UiAgent`.

1.  **Initialization & Handshake**: The application creates a `UiAgent` and calls `startSession()`. The agent then uses its internal `GenUIClient` to send the catalog to the server and receive a `sessionId`.
2.  **User Interaction**: The user provides input (e.g., through a chat interface or by interacting with a generated UI).
3.  **Event Handling**: UI events are passed to the `UiEventManager`. State-changing events (like typing in a text field) are cached. Action events (like tapping a button) trigger the manager to send all cached events for that surface to the `UiAgent`.
4.  **API Call**: The `UiAgent` calls `sendUiEvents` or `sendRequest`, which packages the events or text into a `UserMessage` and adds it to the conversation history.
5.  **Streaming Request**: The `UiAgent` calls `genUIClient.generateUI`, which makes the HTTP request with the full conversation history and returns a `Stream<ChatMessage>`.
6.  **Processing Stream**: The `UiAgent` listens to the stream. As each `AiUiMessage` (containing a UI definition) or `AiTextMessage` arrives, it calls `genUiManager.addOrUpdateSurface(...)` or adds it to the conversation.
7.  **Rendering**: The `GenUiManager` notifies the appropriate `GenUiSurface` widget, which rebuilds to show the latest changes in real-time.
